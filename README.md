# Borderize Chrome Extension

![Example Usage](example.gif)

The Borderize extension adds a red border to every HTML element on a page that does not contain a `data-id` attribute. This extension is useful for developers who want to visualize the elements on their page that lack this attribute.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the extension in your Chrome browser:

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. At the top-right of the screen, turn on **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded or cloned this repository and select it.

The Borderize extension should now be installed on your Chrome browser.

## How to Use

1. Click the Borderize icon in your extensions bar to open the popup.
2. In the popup, click the switch to turn the extension on or off.
   - When the extension is on, a red border will be added to every HTML element on your current page that does not contain a `data-id` attribute.
   - When the extension is off, the borders will be removed.

Note: The extension is off by default when you first install it or open a new tab. You need to manually turn it on for each page where you want to add the borders.
